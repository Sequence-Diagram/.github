## What is Sequence Diagram for Mac?

**Sequence Diagram** is a focused macOS app for designing, editing, and presenting **UML sequence diagrams**. It lets architects, developers, QA engineers, and educators express interactions between objects over time—calls, returns, async messages, activation bars, fragments, and lifelines—using a clean, Mac-native interface.

The editor supports both **visual drag-and-drop** and **text-based sources** (PlantUML/Mermaid style). You can sketch quickly with the mouse, or type interactions in a structured DSL and watch the diagram update instantly. Fragments (alt/opt/loop/try/catch/critical), notes, and combined fragments are easy to add and rearrange, which makes the app ideal for **system design reviews, integration diagrams, and API call flows**.

For collaboration and documentation, the app exports **PNG/SVG/PDF** at retina quality and embeds neatly in wikis, tickets, and architecture docs. Version-friendly text sources mean diagrams fit naturally into Git repos. Presenters get distraction-free **presentation mode** with zoom and step-through animations to reveal flows one interaction at a time.

Performance is tuned for large diagrams with many lifelines and nested fragments. An outline panel, minimap, and search keep navigation under control, while alignment guides and grid snapping produce polished diagrams without pixel fuss. Themes and custom color palettes align visuals with brand or dark-mode preferences.

Whether you’re mapping a microservice handshake, teaching asynchronous flows, or writing a test plan, **Sequence Diagram** turns rough ideas into precise, shareable visuals—fast.
